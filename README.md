The button located in the top right corner has the functionality to switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode.

On the left-hand side, underneath the timer, there are several buttons with different functions:

Play / Pause: This button starts or pauses the timer.

Stop: This button stops the timer.

+: This button adds 5 minutes to the timer.

-: This button subtracts 5 minutes from the timer.

On the right-hand side, there are several cards. Each card changes color and plays a different sound when selected. The sounds are associated with a forest, rain, caf√©, or fireplace. Additionally, each card has a volume slider beneath it, which can be used to adjust the volume. By default, clicking anywhere on a card sets the volume to 50%.
